= Yet another web fiddle

This is a simple HTML, CSS and Javascript playground.

I wanted something working without an internet connection, because every now and then either my connection or some online fiddle service's connection is flakey.
I also wanted something simple, I could understand and run myself on a local webserver.

Just dump the sources in some directory and open the location in your webbrowser.
